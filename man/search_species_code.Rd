\item{authority}{Character. The authority to compare codes against (defaults

\examples{

# Show all ids
search_species_code()

# Get all species ids for house finches
search_species_code("HOFI")

# Get all species ids for Dark-eyed Juncos
search_species_code("DEJU")

# Get all species ids related to Yellow-rumped Warbler (Myrtle)
# NOTE! This includes Audubon's and the main, Yellow-rumped Warbler species
search_species_code("MYWA")

# Get ONLY specific id related to Yellow-rumped Warbler (Myrtle)
search_species_code("MYWA", results = "exact")

# Use the Christmas Bird Count authority
search_species_code(11609, authority = "CBC")

# Look in more than one authority (note that the code only needs to match on
# of the authorities)
search_species_code("MYWA", authority = c("BCMA", "CBC"))
