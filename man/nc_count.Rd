\title{Download information about NatureCounts collections}
\usage{
nc_count(collections = NULL, project_ids = NULL, species = NULL,
  years = NULL, doy = NULL, region = NULL, site_type = NULL,
  show = "available", username = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{collections}{Character vector. The collection codes from which to
download data. NULL (default) downloads data from all available collections}

\item{project_ids}{Character/Numeric vector. The \code{project id}s from which to
download data. First the collections associated with a \code{project_id} are
determined, and then data is downloaded for each collection. If both
\code{collections} and \code{project_ids} are supplied, they are combined.}

\item{species}{Numeric vector. Numeric species ids (see details)}

\item{years}{Numeric vector. The start/end years of data to download. Can use
NA for either start or end, or a single value to return data from a single
year.}

\item{doy}{Character/Numeric vector. The start/end day-of-year to download
(1-366 or dates that can be converted to day of year). Can use NA for
either start or end}

\item{region}{List. Named list with \emph{one} of the following options:
\code{country}, \code{statprov}, \code{subnational2}, \code{iba}, \code{bcr}, \code{utm_squares}, \code{bbox}.
See details}

\item{site_type}{Character vector. The type of site to return (e.g., \code{IBA}).}

\item{show}{Character. Either "all" or "available". "all" returns counts from
all data sources. "available" only returns counts for data available
(public or accessible with the token provided).}

\item{username}{Character vector. Username for \url{http://naturecounts.ca}. If
provided, the user will be prompted for a password. If left NULL, only
public collections will be returned.}
}
\value{
Data frame
}
\description{
Download the number of records available for different collections filtered
by location (if provided). If authorization is provided, the collections are
filtered to only those available to the user. Otherwise all collections are
returned.
}
\section{NatureCounts account}{

All public data is available without a username/password. However, to
access private/semi-public projects/collections you must
\href{https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/register.jsp}{sign up}
for a free NatureCounts account and
\href{https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/projects.jsp}{register}
for the projects you'd like to access.
}

\section{Species ids (\code{species})}{

Numeric species id codes can determined from the functions
\code{\link{species_search}()} or \code{\link{species_code_search}()}. See
also the \link{species codes}
(https://birdstudiescanada.github.io/naturecounts/articles/species-codes.html)
for more information.
}

\section{Day of Year (\code{doy})}{

The format for day of year (\code{doy}) is fairly flexible and can be a whole
number between 1 and 366 or anything recognized by
\code{\link[lubridate]{lubridate-package}}'s \code{\link[lubridate]{ymd}()}
function. However, it must have the order of year, month, day. Note that
year is ignored when converting to day of year, except that it will result
in a 1 day offset for leap years.
}

\section{Regions (\code{region})}{

Regions are defined by codes reflecting the country, state/province,
subnational (level 2), Important Bird Areas (IBA), and Bird Conservation
Regions (BCR) (see \code{\link[=region_search]{region_search()}} for codes). They can also be defined
by providing specific UTM squares to download or a bounding box area which
specifyings the min/max longitude and min/max latitude (\code{bbox}). See the
article on \link{regional filters}
(http://BirdStudiesCanada.github.io/naturecounts/articles/region-codes.html)
for more information.
