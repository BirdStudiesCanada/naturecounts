\section{\code{request_id}'s}{

There are two types of data requests: ones made through the api (i.e. this
\code{naturecounts} R package) and those made through the online \href{https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form}. Each
request generates a request id which identifies the filter set and
collections requested.

Requests made through this package via the \code{\link[=nc_data_dl]{nc_data_dl()}} function only
return data the user has access to. If data was successfully downloaded, the
user can see the request details with the \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}} function.

Requests made through the online \href{https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form} may
include collections to which the user does not have access. \code{\link[=nc_requests]{nc_requests()}}
will list the requests along with the approval status (either 'approved' or
'pending').

Any approved request id can be downloaded by supplying the \code{request_id} to
\code{\link[=nc_data_dl]{nc_data_dl()}} (e.g., \code{nc_data_dl(request_id = 152000, username = "USER")}).
}

\examples{
nc_requests(username = "sample")
nc_requests(request_id = 152446, username = "sample")
