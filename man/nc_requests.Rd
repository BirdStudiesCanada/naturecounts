\description{
List pending or completed data requests for a given user.
}
\details{
There are two types of data requests: ones made through the api
(i.e. \code{naturecounts} R package) and those made through the online \href{https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form}.

Requests made through this package via the \code{\link[=nc_data_dl]{nc_data_dl()}} function only
return data the user has access to. If data was successfully downloaded, the
user can see the request details with this function.

Requests made through the online \href{https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/searchquery.jsp}{Web Request Form} may
include collections to which the user does not have access. This function
will list the requests along with the approval status (either 'approved' or
'pending')
